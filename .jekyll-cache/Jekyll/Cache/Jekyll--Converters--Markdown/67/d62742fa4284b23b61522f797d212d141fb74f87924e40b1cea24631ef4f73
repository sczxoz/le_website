I"<p>I’ve been listening to <em>Landslide</em> by Fleetwood Mac quite a bit of late. The lyrics follow below.</p>

<h4 id="landslide">Landslide</h4>

<p>I took my love, I took it down<br />
I climbed a mountain and I turned around<br />
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br />
’Till the landslide brought me down<br /></p>

<p>Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?<br />
Can the child within my heart rise above?<br />
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?<br />
Can I handle the seasons of my life?<br /></p>

<p>Well, I’ve been afraid of changing<br />
’Cause I’ve built my life around you<br />
But time makes you bolder<br />
Even children get older<br />
And I’m getting older too<br /></p>

<p>Well, I’ve been afraid of changing<br />
’Cause I’ve built my life around you<br />
But time makes you bolder<br />
Even children get older<br />
And I’m getting older too<br />
Oh, I’m getting older too<br /></p>

<p>Oh, take my love, take it down<br />
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around<br />
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br />
Well the landslide will bring it down<br />
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br />
Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh<br />
The landslide will bring it down<br /></p>
