          <p>Hi, I’m Stef. I see technological development as the central focus of my professional life.</p>

          <p>I currently work as a entry-level engineer in the field of control and automation. Previously, I obtained a master’s degree in electrical engineering, with focus on residential renewable energy optimization, at Stellenbosch University, South Africa. Prior to that, I completed a bachelor’s degree in electrical and electronic engineering, also at S.U.</p>

If you’d like to read something I wrote, head over to the <a href="https://stefcoetzee.com/writing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"">writing page</a>. Naturally, all views are my own.</p>
