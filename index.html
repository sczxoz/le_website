    <h2>Some more words</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
          Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
          Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
          Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
          And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
        </p>

    <h3>An h3 heading</h3>
    <p>The text that justified adding <em>another </em> damned heading.</p>
    <h3>Here we have another heading</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Koch">Charles Koch</a> droppin’ some knowledge (emphasis mine): “The more books I read, the more passionately I embraced the truth that widespread human well-being demands a system that clearly defines and <strong>protects private property rights</strong>, allows people to speak freely without intimidation or legal repercussions, refrains from interference with private parties’ agreements and exchanges, and allows human action—rather than <em>arbitrary</em> notions about how much things “should” cost—to guide prices.” This excerpt is taken from his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Profit-Creating-Successful-Companies-ebook/dp/B00TWEMGE8">Good Profit</a>.</p>
