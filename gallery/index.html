    <h1>Landslide</h1>

    <em>by Fleetwood Mac</em>
    
    <p>
        I took my love, I took it down<br>
        I climbed a mountain and I turned around<br>
        And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br>
        ’Till the landslide brought me down<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?<br>
        Can the child within my heart rise above?<br>
        Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?<br>
        Can I handle the seasons of my life?<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Well, I’ve been afraid of changing<br>
        ’Cause I've built my life around you<br>
        But time makes you bolder<br>
        Even children get older<br>
        And I’m getting older too<br>
    </p>
