I've been listening to *Landslide* by Fleetwood Mac quite a bit of late. The lyrics follow below.

#### Landslide

I took my love, I took it down<br>
I climbed a mountain and I turned around<br>
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br>
’Till the landslide brought me down<br>

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?<br>
Can the child within my heart rise above?<br>
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?<br>
Can I handle the seasons of my life?<br>

Well, I’ve been afraid of changing<br>
’Cause I’ve built my life around you<br>
But time makes you bolder<br>
Even children get older<br>
And I’m getting older too<br>

Well, I’ve been afraid of changing<br>
’Cause I’ve built my life around you<br>
But time makes you bolder<br>
Even children get older<br>
And I’m getting older too<br>
Oh, I’m getting older too<br>

Oh, take my love, take it down<br>
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around<br>
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br>
Well the landslide will bring it down<br>
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br>
Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh<br>
The landslide will bring it down<br>
